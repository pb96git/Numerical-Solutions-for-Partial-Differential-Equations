# Numerical-Solutions-for-Partial-Differential-Equations

This repository contains codes and documentation developed as part of the PhD course Numerical Solutions for Partial Differential Equations at the University of South-Eastern Norway(USN).
As a course material books used are: Finite Difference Computing with PDEs: A Modern Software Approach by Hans Petter Langtangen and Svein Linge and 
Riemann solvers and numerical methods for fluid dynamics: a practical introduction by Toro, E. F.


    The code is currently in development and serves as a learning tool for:
    Part 1:  Solving ODEs of 1-degree-of-freedom (1DOF) vibration systems. Ch. 1 - Langtangen, Linge (September 2024)
    Part 2:  Solving 1D wave PDEs with option of variable velocity.  Ch. 2 - Langtangen, Linge (October 2024)
    Part 3:  Solving 1D and 2D diffusion PDEs.  Ch. 3 - Langtangen, Linge (November 2024)
    Part 4:  Software Engineering - Wave Equation Model.  Appendix C - Langtangen, Linge  (November 2024)
    Part 5:  Riemann Solvers: solving the Riemann problem for the 1D Euler equations for an ideal gas. - Ch. 4, 5, 6 Toro, E. F. (December 2024)
     

    This repository is primarily intended for educational purposes and to assist in learning numerical methods 
    for solving ODE in mechanical vibration systems, wave PDEs and diffusion PDEs, Riemann solvers for 1D Euler Equation and their programming in Python.

    I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT for writing assistance and code debugging in the preparation of this repository.
