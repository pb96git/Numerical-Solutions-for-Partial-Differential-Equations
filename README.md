# Numerical-Solutions-for-Partial-Differential-Equations

This repository contains codes and documentation developed as part of the PhD course Numerical Solutions for Partial Differential Equations at the University of South-Eastern Norway(USN). 
As a course material books used are: Finite Difference Computing with PDEs: A Modern Software Approach by Hans Petter Langtangen and Svein Linge and 
Riemann solvers and numerical methods for fluid dynamics: a practical introduction by Toro, E. F.

I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT as a tool for writing assistance and code debugging used in the preparation of this repository.

    


    The code is currently in development and serves as a learning tool for:
    Part 1:  Solving 1-degree-of-freedom (1DOF) vibration systems.
    Part 2:  Solving 1D wave PDE with option of variable velocity.
    
    How to Use:
    
    Copy and Paste a Problem Example:
    Select one of the example codes (file starting with Ex) and use it as a template to define your system.
    
    Set Custom Functions:
    Modify the template by defining functions specific to your 1DOF vibration system. 
    Ensure that you implement the appropriate damping, restoring force, and external force functions.
    
    This code is primarily intended for educational purposes and to assist in learning numerical methods 
    for solving differential equations in mechanical vibration systems, wave PDE.
